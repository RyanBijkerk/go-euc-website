Tricerat has obsessed over printing and scanning for more than 23 years. Tricerat started by pioneering the first ever Virtual Print Driver and developed our own page description language.

Since then, we’ve expanded our technology stack to an entire suite of printing and scanning solutions that enable even the most complex IT environments to experience simplicity and steep bottom line savings.

Eliminate print management headaches, improve workflows, and save resources with a cross-platform print management solution. With features like mobile and Direct IP printing, you can take enterprise printing capabilities wherever your users go.

ScrewDrivers® offers a centralized, drag and drop dashboard to manage all of your enterprise printing needs – no matter the user count or environment. Assign printers at a granular level based on users, groups and/or workstations. Integration with Active Directory to manage and map native printer drivers, giving enhanced flexibility for a variety of user requirements.

Our support team has an average NPS of 73 and always shows up to deliver unique customer success to our 10,000+ global customer base. That’s why industry leaders like McKesson, Wyndham Vacation Group, Costco, and Estes trust us to help them, and continue to help year after year.
